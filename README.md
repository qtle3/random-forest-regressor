# Salary Prediction using Random Forest Regression

This project demonstrates the use of **Random Forest Regression** to predict the salary of an employee based on their position level. The script leverages a dataset containing position levels and corresponding salaries, and trains a Random Forest model to make predictions for various position levels.

## Detailed Summary

The script begins by loading the `Position_Salaries.csv` dataset, which includes employee position levels and their respective salaries. A **Random Forest Regressor** model is then trained on this dataset. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to provide a more robust and accurate estimate.
